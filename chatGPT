New release to FastChat 🎉

FastChat is an open platform for training, serving, and evaluating large language model-based chatbots. The platform includes the Vicuña - an open-source chatbot based on Python created by a team of researchers from UC Berkeley, CMU, Stanford, and UC San Diego.

Version 0.2.3 was released this week with an awesome feature - Chatbot Arena that enables performance comparison between a variety of open-source LLMs. That includes the following LLMs:
✅ Vicuna: a chat assistant fine-tuned from LLaMA on user-shared conversations.
✅ Koala: a chatbot fine-tuned from LLaMA on user-shared conversations and open-source datasets.
✅ OpenAssistant (oasst): a chat-based assistant for everyone.
✅ Dolly: an instruction-tuned open LLM by Databricks.
✅ ChatGLM: an open bilingual dialogue language model
✅ StableLM: Stability AI language models.
✅ Alpaca: a model fine-tuned from LLaMA on 52K instruction-following demonstrations.
✅ LLaMA: open and efficient foundation language models.
