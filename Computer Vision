🛫 Researchers publish a lot of work every month in an effort to give technology fresh life. About 8,000 articles are added to the arXiv each month; that's about 250 every day. It's tough to go through all this gold mine and figure out which documents are worth keeping. 

✈️ So, This new series, Computer Vision Papers of this Week, is something I've decided to start. This will be released weekly and include articles containing codes for all the most recent papers published by prestigious institutions and organizations.

Image Segmentation by Sayak Paul
Segmentation is an important use case in computer vision. To help the community deliver amazing custom segmentation models, 
we have developed full-length fine-tuning tutorials for segmentation in both TensorFlow and PyTorch.
We also provide a separate dataset loading guide for semantic segmentation 👉

https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/semantic_segmentation
It shows how to use the 🤗 Datasets library along with `albumentations` to prepare your segmentation datasets for training
Check out the comments of this post for links to the resources that we offer on segmentation 🤗
We have a separate task page on segmentation to help you navigate across all the compatible datasets and models we have on the 🤗 Hub:

PyTorch Notebook: https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/semantic_segmentation.ipynb

TensorFlow Notebook: https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/semantic_segmentation-tf.ipynb

Finally, if you're looking to scalably deploy your SegFormer models, then this guide from Philipp Schmid is a great starting point:
