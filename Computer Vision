🛫 Researchers publish a lot of work every month in an effort to give technology fresh life. About 8,000 articles are added to the arXiv each month; that's about 250 every day. It's tough to go through all this gold mine and figure out which documents are worth keeping. 

✈️ So, This new series, Computer Vision Papers of this Week, is something I've decided to start. This will be released weekly and include articles containing codes for all the most recent papers published by prestigious institutions and organizations.
